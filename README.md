ORDER OF EXECUTION WHEN DOING YOUR OWN CODE:
1. BEFORE STARTING - __git pull__ - this is to get the latest version of code
2. Once you have made some code - __git add .__ - this signals to git that whichever bit of code that you changed is complete. Don't worry, you can always change files you have added later.
3. Once you are ready to commit your code to the master branch(making your code the latest version), first commit then push your code.
-  __git commit -m "_entersometextaboutwhatyouchangedhere_"__ - replacing the text in strings with a short statement describing the changes you made to your code.
- __git push__ - to push your code to master

Things to keep in mind:
Whenever you change code, please write a small multi-line comment at the top of the file which you changed explaining what you changed in the file, what you were supposed to do, and if it worked or not - this greatly helps in debugging. Also put who wrote the code so we can contact you if need be.

Here is an [example](ExampleWriteup.PNG) of that paragraph.
